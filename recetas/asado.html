    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Asado is meat grilled in its purest form. Traditionally, the fire used to cook the meat is made with a combination of red-hot coals and firewood, though the exact type of wood may vary from region to region.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2½ kg meat flank steak, flap, skirt steak, tenderloin. But always choose the ribs and a cut of meat.</li>
        <li>6 chorizo sausages.</li>
        <li>400 g chinchulines: chinchulines is a term that makes reference to the offal of the cow such as the small intestine, kidneys and sweetbread. Black pudding is usually considered in this group too.</li>
        <li>2 lemons</li>
        <li>Coarse salt</li>
        <li>Marinade: optional if using kidneys</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Serve with:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mini baguettes toasted lightly on the grill for a minute before serving the sausages</li>
        <li>Simple salad</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Chimichurri (just combine all ingredients. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes before serving)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup olive oil 250 ml</li>
        <li>1 tbsp white-wine vinegar</li>
        <li>½ cup fresh parsley 30 g, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh oregano 15 g, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh thyme 15 g, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup onion 30 g, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tbsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>Salt and cayenne pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    
    <h3>Preparations:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Before you start, soak the chorizos in bowl until you are ready to cook them. This is to prevent dryness after cooking.</li>
        <li>Make a fire using charcoal, wood and paper. This would probably take you around an hour.</li>
        <li>Once you have the fire ready, distribute the embers so you have a high heat and a low heat area. Sprinkle some salt on top of the embers to prevent the ashes from rising too much.</li>
        <li>Keep to the side a small additional fire going from where you can take embers to put in the main fire when needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Prepare the meat:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>If you’re making chinchulines you need to wash and clean them very well. They take a long time to cook, around 1 or 1,5 hours. Make sure they are on a low heat and far from the meat to prevent the chinchulines from giving the meat their flavor.</li>
        <li>a. Small intestine: after cleaning and taking the fat out, make a braid or just roll it in a circle and put it on the grill. Turn it after 30 minutes and add salt.</li>
        <li>b. Kidneys: Peeled off the membrane they come in, take out the renal pelvis and after washing, leave overnight in water with vinegar, red wine or milk (3:1). When cooking on the grill put first the side that has the opening of the renal pelvis so it would finish draining. Turn around once the kidney has a more rigid texture to the touch (around 30-40 minutes). Don’t forget to add salt.</li>
        <li>c. Chorizos: just take them out of the water and put them on the grill.</li>
        <li>d. Black pudding: since this is already cooked, add it last to the grill, 30 min after after the rest.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle coarse salt and lemon juice on both side of the meat.</li>
        <li>Put the meat on the grill, fat side down and let it cook for at least 40 min - one hour, turning the meat every 15 or 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the ribs on the grill. They are ready in 15 - 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the meat is ready, cut it in portions and put them in a large plate so everyone can choose what they want.</li>
    </ol>
