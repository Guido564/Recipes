    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Choripán (plural: choripanes) is a type of sandwich with chorizo popular in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, and El Salvador. The name comes from the combination of the names of its ingredients: a grilled chorizo sausage and a crusty bread (Spanish: pan) such as a pan batido, baguette, or francés.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
    <h3>For the choripan</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 fresh chorizo sausages, Argentinian-style if possible </li>
        <li>Four 6-inch hero rolls, split lengthwise, connected on one side like a hinge </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>For the chimichurri</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup finely chopped fresh Italian parsley leaves </li>
        <li>¼ cup minced white onion </li>
        <li>1 small garlic clove, grated on a microplane </li>
        <li>¼ cup plus 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil </li>
        <li>3 Tbsp. red wine vinegar </li>
        <li>½ tsp. kosher salt </li>
        <li>¼ tsp. freshly ground black pepper </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the choripán: Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat or a grill to medium heat. Add the chorizo and let cook, turning occasionally with tongs as needed, until the sides are deeply seared and the center is fully cooked through, 30–35 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the chimichurri: In a medium jar or bowl, add the parsley, onion, and garlic and stir briefly to combine. Add the olive oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper, and stir well. Let rest at least 15 minutes. (Chimichurri can be left out at room temperature for up to 12 hours before serving.) </li>
        <li> If desired, briefly warm the insides of the rolls over the grill as desired. You can also split the sausages lengthwise if desired. </li>
        <li>Place one cooked sausage into each roll. Slather one side of the roll and some of the sausage generously with chimichurri, and serve immediately. </li>
    </ol>
